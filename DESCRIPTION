Description: 
    Implement functions in support of manuscript 
    "Bayesian clustering using random effects models and predictive projections". 
    The main goal of the algorithm is to cluster longitudinal data (not necessarily
    equally sampled) into several clusters based on chosen random 
    effects in a Bayesian linear mixed model setting. Cluster number optimisation 
    is integrated, but manual selection is allowed. A few benchmark methods are 
    supplied to compare with BayesPC. Example of crop image data is built in to 
    demonstrate the algorithm.
