Description: Implement functions in support of manuscript 
    "Bayesian clustering using random effects models and predictive projections". 
    The main goal of the algorithm is to cluster longitudinal data with freely spaced
    time points into several clusters based on chosen random 
    effects in a Bayesian linear mixed model setting. Cluster number optimisation 
    is integrated within, while manual selection is also allowed. 
    A few traditional clustering methods are included to benchmark with BayesPC. 
    Example of a simulated dataset is supplied to demonstrate the algorithm usage.
